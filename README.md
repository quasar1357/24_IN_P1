# Programmierung 1 - UniBern 2024

This is the repository of *Roman Schwob* for "Programmierung 1", part of the Bachelorâ€™s program in "Informatik" at the University of Bern.

It contains my solutions to the exercise series as well as the code written during the workshops ([here](./Exercises_and_Workshops/)).

Additionally, I have written a [Java Syntax Guide](./Java_SyntaxGuide/00_Java_SyntaxGuide.md), based on information from the lecture and the script, complemented by online research, and assisted by ChatGPT. It provides an overview of the most important building blocks of the Java language, without delving into general programming concepts.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me through GitHub.
