# Programmierung 1 - UniBern 2024

This is the repository of *Roman Schwob* for "Programmierung 1" of the Bachelor in "Informatik" at the University of Bern.

In the second part of the readme below is a *Syntax Guide for Java* that I create based on the script used in the lecture. The *folders* in the repository contain my solutions to the exercise series.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me through GitHub.
